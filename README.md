# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This package is a collection of my attempts at using the Gilded Rose Kata for some refactoring practice in multiple languages.

This package was based on the code found in https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

The original code (starting point for the excercise) can be found in the `original` folder. 

The refactored code, with tests, can be found in the `refactor` folder.
